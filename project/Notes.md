- A class for nuclear warheads.
- A class for scenarios, which uses instances of the class of nuclear warheads.
- Keep track of the different gases used to model the chemical composition of the atmosphere to make them easy to change (e.g. an appropriate class for gases, use specific library for computation of spectral absorption).
